                Love how the internet make life so much easier for most part. As a heavy internet user, I spend a lot of time online. Finally after a decade of using it, I want to learn more about it and try really hard to become one of those web magicians who make things one click away.

                Learning new things is very similar to living in a foreign country. Everything looks like alien language at beginning till you start to learn it and understand how it work. Event though I still feel like reading alien language most of time after 4 classes, creating page from scratch still feel pretty amazing.
